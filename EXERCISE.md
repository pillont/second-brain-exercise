# Exercise: Building a Simple Task Management API

## Objective

Design and implement a RESTful API for managing tasks. The API should allow users to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks. Additionally, implement user authentication to secure the API.

## Requirements

### Task Model

Define a Task model with the following attributes:

- ID (auto-generated)
- Title
- Description
- Due Date
- Status (e.g., "Incomplete," "Complete")

### API Endpoints

Implement the following RESTful endpoints using a framework of your choice (e.g., Flask, Express, Django):

- `POST /tasks` — Create a new task
- `GET /tasks` — Retrieve a list of all tasks
- `GET /tasks/{id}` — Retrieve details of a specific task by ID
- `PUT /tasks/{id}` — Update the details of a specific task
- `DELETE /tasks/{id}` — Delete a specific task

### User Authentication

- Implement a simple user authentication system using JWT
- Create endpoints for user registration and login
- Ensure that task-related endpoints are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users

### Validation and Error Handling

- Implement proper input validation for task creation and update
- Handle errors gracefully and return meaningful error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes

### Testing

- Write unit tests for at least one endpoint
- Include tests for both successful and unsuccessful scenarios

## Additional Considerations (Optional)

- Implement pagination for the list of tasks to manage large datasets
- Add filtering options to retrieve tasks based on status, due date, etc.
- Include sorting options for the list of tasks
- Use a database of your choice (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) to persist task and user data

## Submission

Share the codebase along with a README file explaining how to set up and run the application. Include details on API usage, authentication, and any additional features implemented.
